*The test coverage shown here works on both SonarQube and SonarCloud. This project is analyzed on https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=sonarsource-cfamily-examples_linux-cmake-gcovr-gh-actions-sc[SonarCloud]!*

:note-caption: :information_source:
NOTE: This simple example aims at demonstrating code coverage in action. It explains how to add coverage on a project for which the analysis is already configured. Analysis configuration examples are available <<code-description,here>>. +
Adding code coverage is done the same way regardless of whether you use the Build Wrapper or a Compilation Database to configure the analysis.

To get coverage and feed it to the sonar-scanner, use the following procedure.

. Add `--coverage` compilation flag to instrument the binaries
. Run the test binaries to count covered lines
. Run `gcovr --sonarqube` to produce the SonarQube- and SonarCloud-compatible XML coverage report
. Point the `sonar.coverageReportPaths` property to the generated coverage-report file
. Run `sonar-scanner` as the final step

You can take a look at the link:sonar-project.properties[sonar-project.properties] and link:.github/workflows/build.yml[build.yml] to see it in practice.

= Code Description

An example of a flawed C++ code. The https://github.com/sonarsource-cfamily-examples/code[code repository] is meant to be compiled with different build systems using different CI pipelines on Linux, MacOS, and Windows.

The https://github.com/sonarsource-cfamily-examples/code[code repository] is forked into other repositories in https://github.com/sonarsource-cfamily-examples[this collection] to add a specific build system, platform, and CI.
The downstream repositories are analyzed either with https://www.sonarqube.org/[SonarQube] or https://sonarcloud.io/[SonarCloud].
